    <h2>Basic info</h2>
   
	    <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale 
		game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean 
		video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created 
		by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese 
		film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative 
		direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and
		scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding <strong>getting <em>killed themselves </strong>.<p>
